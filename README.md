# Edge-Detection

1. Edge Detection based on Heat Conduction (ED-HC) is intended to reveal or sharpen the edges of objects in infrared images.
2. The feature of ED-HC aims to make edge detection according to the conditions and heat flow properties of the surface temperatures in the infrared image.
3. The ED-HC is based on Heat Conduction Matrix (HCM).
4. HCM is a feature matrix which the heat conduction formula of solid and still fluids is applied to the infrared image and which examines the difference values between neighboring pixels.
5. By applying the ED-HC method to gray level images, the method has proven to be valid for gray level images.
6. ED-HC method has strong performance in infrared images with excessive blur and low brightness-contrast.
